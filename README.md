It's a simple way to automate the cut up technique of literary composition.  The user gives phrases they wish to appear in the text, and the number of syllables that they pronounce them with, and the number of syllables they want in each line, and the site does the rest.

Future plans include the option of specifying syllabic stress pattens so that effective meter can be implemented.
